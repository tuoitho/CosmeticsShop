### üöÄ Running the Project with Docker (not recommended)

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Docker and Docker Compose
Make sure you have **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed.
- [Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

Verify installation:
```sh
docker -v
```
```sh
docker-compose -v
```

---

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Prepare the `docker-compose.yml` File
Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in any directory

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  app:
    image: tuoitho/cosmetics-shop-bmw:latest
    ports:
      - "8081:8081"
    environment:
      - DB_URL=jdbc:mysql://db:3306/cosmeticsshop
      - DB_USER=root
      - DB_PASS=123456
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy

  db:
    image: mysql:8.0
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: 123456
      MYSQL_DATABASE: cosmeticsshop
    ports:
      - "3399:3306"

      interval: 10s
      retries: 5
```

---

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Project
Navigate to the directory containing `docker-compose.yml` and execute:
```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

This will:
- Pull the latest MySQL and application images
- Start both containers in detached mode (`-d` means detached)

To check running containers:
```sh
docker ps
```

---

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Verify the Application
After running the containers, open your browser and visit:
- **Home Page:** [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)

If you want to check the database:
```sh
docker exec -it <mysql_container_id> mysql -u root -p123456
```
Replace `<mysql_container_id>` with the actual container ID of MySQL (`docker ps` to get it).

---

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Stop and Remove Containers
To stop the project:
```sh
docker-compose down
```
To remove all containers and volumes (reset data):
